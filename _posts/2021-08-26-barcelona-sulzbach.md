At the end of summer 2021, when Corona was still in summer break, my colleague Biel and me took the chance for a cycling adventure through northern Spain, France and southern Germany. For some days we took the same route as I did in spring time, but continued through the Pyrenees, following the the Mediterranean Sea to Montpelier, then along river Rhône to Lyon and further along the Saône and Doubs to Basel, Ulm and finally Sulzbach.

# Getting to Barcelona

I again took the train via Paris to get to Barcelona. It takes quite long (about 13 hours) but it's very comfortable and you get nice and very nice relaxing views while riding 300 km/h through France. You can take the bike in pretty much every train as long as the overall package is not too big, so I had to disassemble it a bit. Luckily the train station in BCN was still busy late at night so I could reassemble it indoors with a lot of light.
Arriving at the hostel was interesting as of course they forgot that I bring a bike, but after a bit of a heated discussion with the older gentleman (he didn't speak a word of English, and I pretty much only know 5 words of Spanish) he agreed to leave the bike in his living room behind his TV chair :-)
I arrived a day early to visit the Sagrada Família, which was closed on my last visit and this was definitely worth it.

# Riding to France (28.08 - 31.08.2021

We started early on the 28th of August. Biel and his parents arrived from Santa Eulàlia de Riuprimer, close to Vic. After a warm welcome and a quick good bye, off we went. The tour was taking us along the coast to L’Escala for some anchovies, then towards France with a little detour to Cadaqués to visit Salvador Dalís house museum and have some paella. After that we took some smaller roads through the Pyrenees to France. Spain does not have a lot of dedicated cycle ways, but drivers are very relaxed, friendly and respectful.
